The website
-----------

#### Notes to self #
- Bootstrap is included as a _subtree_ based on the bootstrap repo
s master branch:: http://git-scm.com/book/ch6-7.html
  (See that link for how the subtree is setup and how to update Bootstrap.)
  Compiling bootstrap w/ grunt: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#grunt
- Actual site .css generated from res/less/theme.less (to include modified Yeti theme)
  There is almost certainly a better way to do this.
- When fixing site permissions, don't make the .git folder public...
- Be sure to .gitignore the forum directory
